Study Group

Study Group is an app that connects students to others interested in forming a study group for any subject. They can do so by browsing the study groups created by other students and add them to their groups. Once a student adds a study group to their groups, they can view posts in that group and add posts themselves to that group with the option to delete their posts. Students also have the option of creating their own group for others to join. 

Feature List:
Students will be able to register and log into the app. They will then be taken to the home page where they can press the "Create a group" button to create a study group of their choosing. There will be a link in the nav bar that takes students to "All Groups" where they can search the study groups and press the + button next to them to add them to their list of groups. Once a student adds a study group tho their groups, they can click the "My Groups" button in the nav bar and see a list of the groups they added or created. Next to each study group will be a view button in which the student can view the posts in that study group, or add a post to the study group and delete their posts.

Technologies: 
Technologies to be used include Auth, Ruby on Rails, and React.

M.V.P
My MVP would be to have a working app in which a user can log in, create a group, view all groups created by other users, add a group to their groups, post to the group, and delete posts from the group. 

Post M.V.P features
My post MVP would include the MVP feature and extend the app to allow a student to select a college, using a third party college API when logging into the app. It would also include some sort of messaging system for study groups. 

I plan on reaching MVP by Wednessday and using Thursday and Friday to go beyond MVP. I would like to have Auth and my routes completed by Monday, creating, and deleting groups to my groups by Tuesday, and posting completed by Wednessday.
